# Product Roadmap: Delusions: Anti-Affirmations

> "Affirmations for people who hate affirmations."

This roadmap outlines the strategic development phases for Delusions, focusing on user retention, viral growth, and monetization through our unique brand.

## Phase 1: The Hook (Retention & Stickiness)
*Goal: Turn casual users into daily "system operatives".*

### 1. ⚡ Reality Checks (Push Notifications 2.0)
Instead of passive affirmations, send interactive "Reality Checks" that demand a response.
*   **Feature:** "Are you overthinking or just thinking?" -> [Yes] [No] [Define 'Thinking']
*   **Mechanism:** Users must interact to dismiss. The app tracks the response and adjusts future tone.
*   **Why:** Increases daily active users (DAU) by forcing a micro-interaction.

### 2. 🔥 The "Sanity Streak"
Gamify consistency without the toxic positivity of "keeping a streak".
*   **Feature:** Track days of "surviving" the system.
*   **Reward:** Unlock new "Dark Mode" personas or "Glitch" themes after 7/14/30 days.
*   **Twist:** If you miss a day, the app doesn't shame you; it just says "System rebooted. Try again."

### 3. 🧠 Smart Vibe Analysis (On-Device ML)
Use basic sentiment analysis on user journal entries (if added) or check-in history.
*   **Feature:** "System Diagnostic Report" - A weekly summary of your mood.
*   **Output:** "Your vibe this week was 80% 'Chaotic Evil'. Recommendation: Go touch grass."
*   **Why:** Provides personal insight, making the app a tool for self-awareness, not just entertainment.

## Phase 2: The Spread (Viral Growth)
*Goal: Leverage our sarcastic brand to break out of the app.*

### 1. 📤 Anti-Social Sharing (Watermarked Cards)
Make sharing "Delusions" a status symbol.
*   **Feature:** One-tap share to Instagram Stories/TikTok with a distinct, terminal-style aesthetic.
*   **Viral Loop:** "Roast a Friend" - Send a specific affirmation to a contact with a custom "System Note".
*   **Design:** High-contrast, "glitch" aesthetics that stand out in feed.

### 2.  widgets 2.0: The "Doomscrolling" Counter
*   **Feature:** A home screen widget that tracks how many times you've unlocked your phone vs. how many reality checks you've completed.
*   **Value:** Provides utility (digital wellbeing) wrapped in our brand's cynicism.

### 3. 🤝 "Misery Loves Company" (Leaderboards)
*   **Feature:** Global stats on the "System Load".
*   **Display:** "74% of users are currently 'Burnt Out'. You are in the majority."
*   **Why:** Validation through shared struggle. Connects users without forced social interaction.

## Phase 3: The System (Monetization & Depth)
*Goal: Sustainable revenue through "System Upgrades".*

### 1. 💎 "Root Access" (Premium Tier)
*   **Unlock:**
    *   **Custom Personas:** Create your own "System Personality" (e.g., "Angry Chef", "Existential Cat").
    *   **Unlimited History:** Access your full timeline of reality checks.
    *   **No Ads / Priority Support:** "Jump the queue in the simulation."

### 2. ⌚ Wearable Integration (WatchOS/WearOS)
*   **Feature:** Haptic "Pulse Checks" on the wrist.
*   **Interaction:** A subtle vibration followed by a single-word reality check (e.g., "Breathe", "Focus", "Abort").

### 3. 🤖 "System AI" (LLM Integration)
*   **Feature:** A chat interface where users can "debug" their day.
*   **Persona:** The AI acts as the selected persona (e.g., The Overthinker robot).
*   **Use Case:** User vents -> AI responds with valid, grounded, non-affirmation advice.
